## The PDB database

The main repository of biomolecular structure data is called the PDB found at https://www.rcsb.org

Let's see what this database contains. I went to PDB > Analysis > PDB Statistics > By Exp method and molecular type

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.
> A1: percentage solved by x-ray is 82.83549%, while the Electron Microscopy is 10.75017%

```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray
```

The comma in these numbers is causing them to be read as characters rather than numeric. This can be fixed by replacing "," with 'sub()' function:

```{r}
x <- pdbstats$X.ray
sum( as.numeric(sub(",", "", x)))
```

Or I can use the **reader** package and the 'read.csv' function 

```{r}
library(readr)
pdbstats <- read_csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```
I want to clean the column name so they are all lower case and don't have spaces in them

```{r}
colnames(pdbstats)
```

```{r}
library(janitor)
df <- clean_names(pdbstats)
df
```

Total number of X-ray structures
```{r}
sum(df$x_ray)
```

Percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-ray
```{r}
sum(df$x_ray)/sum(df$total) * 100
```

Total number of EM (Electron Microscopy)
```{r}
sum(df$em)/sum(df$total) * 100
```

Total number of structures
```{r}
sum(df$total)
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?
> A2: 0.8623852

```{r}
( df[1, "total"])/sum(df$total)
```



The main Mol* homepage at:  https://molstar.org/viewer/. We can input our own PDB files or just give it a PDB database accession code (4 letter PDB code)

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?
> A4: In this case, the hydrogen atoms are attached at a certain angle that makes them not visible and makes the molecule polar.

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have
> A5: Yes, it is water 308.

> Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

## 3. Intro to Bio3D in R

We can use the **bio3D** package for structural bioinformatics to read PDB data into R

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")

pdb
```


> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 
> A7: There are 198 amino acid residues.

```{r}
length(pdbseq(pdb))
```


> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 
> A8: MK1

> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 
> A9:There are 2, chains A and B


Looking at the 'pdb()' object in more detail

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

Let's try a new function not yet in the bio3d package. It requires the **r3dmol** package that we need to install with 'install.packages("r3dmol")' and 'install.packages("shiny")'

```{r}
#source("https://tinyurl.com/viewpdb")
#view.pdb(pdb, backgroundColor = "white")
```



> Q10. Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN? 
> A10: BiocManager

> Q11. Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN?:
> A11. The bio3d package.

> Q12. True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket? 
> A12. True

## 4. Predicting functional dynamics 

We can use the 'nma()' function in bio3d to predict the large-scale functional motion of biomolecules.

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```
Write out a trajectory of the predicted molecular motion:
```{r}
meow <- mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

> Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence? 
> A13. This sequence is 214 amino acids long.

```{r}
library(bio3d)
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
aa
```
